# Non Fibonacci Number
Given a positive integer N, your task is to print the Nth non Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

Fib(0) = 0

Fib(1) = 1

for n >1, Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 5
Output: 10
Explaination: The first 5 non-fibonacci 
numbers are 4, 6, 7, 9, 10.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: N = 15
Output: 22
Explaination: The fibonacci numbers 
are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. Here 
22 becomes the 15th non-fibonacci 
number.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **nonFibonacci()** which takes the value N and returns the Nth non-fibonacci number.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
