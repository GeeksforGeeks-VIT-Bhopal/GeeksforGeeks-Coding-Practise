# Fibonacci in the array
Given an array arr of size N, the task is to count the number of elements of the array which are Fibonacci numbers

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 9, arr[] = {4, 2, 8, 5, 20, 1, 
                              40, 13, 23}
Output: 5
Explanation: Here, Fibonacci series will 
be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55. 
Numbers that are present in array are 
2, 8, 5, 1, 13
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: N = 4, arr[] = {4, 7, 6, 25} 
Output: 0
Explanation: No Fibonacci number in 
this array.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function **checkFib()** that takes array arr and integer N as parameters and returns the desired output.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).
