My friend generated a series **1 4 8 9 12 17 25 28** .... . Each element of this series is known as "**Dory**". Your task is to find out whether a number n is **Dory** or not.<br>
**NOTE:** If n is "**Dory**", then return 1 else return 0.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 4

its present in the series.
```
