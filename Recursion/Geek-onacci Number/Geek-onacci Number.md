# Geek-onacci Number

Geek created a random series and given a name geek-onacci series. Given four integers A, B, C, N. A, B, C represents the first three numbers of geek-onacci series. Find the Nth number of the series. The nth number of geek-onacci series is a sum of the last three numbers (summation of N-1th, N-2th, and N-3th geek-onacci numbers)

**Input:**
1. The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
2. The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, C, and N.

**Output:** For each test case, print Nth geek-onacci number
