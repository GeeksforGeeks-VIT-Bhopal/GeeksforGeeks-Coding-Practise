# Find all possible palindromic partitions of a String

Given a String S, Find all possible Palindromic partitions of the given String.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
S = "geeks"
Output:
g e e k s
g ee k s
Explanation:
All possible palindromic partitions
are printed.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
S = "madam"
Output:
m a d a m
m ada m
madam
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function allPalindromicPerms() which takes a String S as input parameter and returns a list of lists denoting all the possible palindromic partitions.

 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N*2N)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N^2), where N is the length of the String
