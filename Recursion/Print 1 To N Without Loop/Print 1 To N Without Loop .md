# Print 1 To N Without Loop 

Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N) (Recursive).
