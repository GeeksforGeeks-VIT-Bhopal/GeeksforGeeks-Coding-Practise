# Count Number of SubTrees having given Sum

Given a binary tree and an integer X. Your task is to complete the function countSubtreesWithSumX() that returns the count of the number of subtress having total nodeâ€™s data sum equal to the value X.<br>
**Example:** For the tree given below:            
```
              5
            /    \
        -10       3
        /    \    / \
      9     8  -4     7

Subtree with sum 7:
             -10
            /    \
          9        8

and one node 7.
```
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
       5
    /    \
  -10     3
 /   \   /  \
 9   8 -4    7
X = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Subtrees with sum 7 are
[9, 8, -10] and [7] (refer the example
in the problem description).
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
    1
  /  \
 2    3
X = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: No subtree has sum equal
to 5.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countSubtreesWithSumX() which takes the root node and an integer X as inputs and returns the number of subtrees of the given Binary Tree having sum exactly equal to X.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(Height of the Tree).

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
