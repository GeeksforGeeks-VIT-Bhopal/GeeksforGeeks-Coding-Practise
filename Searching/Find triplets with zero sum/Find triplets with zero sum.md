# Find triplets with zero sum

Given an array arr[] of n integers. Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5, arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}

Output: 1

Explanation: 0, -1 and 1 forms a triplet
with sum equal to 0.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}

Output: 0

Explanation: No triplet with zero sum exists. 
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the boolean function findTriplets() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array (n) as inputs and print 1 if the function returns true else print false if the function return false. 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n2)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
