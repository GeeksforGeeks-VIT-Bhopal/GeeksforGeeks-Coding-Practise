# Super Primes
A prime number is Super Prime if it is a sum of two primes. Find all the Super Primes upto N

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 5

Output: 1

only super prime
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 10 

Output: 2

**Your Task:**<br> 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **superPrimes()** which takes the N as input and returns the count of super primes.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(Nlog(logN))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N)
