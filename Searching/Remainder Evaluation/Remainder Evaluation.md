# Remainder Evaluation

Given two positive integers num1 and num2, the task is to find the remainder when num1 is divided by num2.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

Output:
2

Explanation:
The remainder after dividing 5 by 3 is: 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
num1 = 5
num2 = 10

Output:
5

Explanation:
5 cannot be divided by 10 so it is 
the Remainder.
```
**Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findRemainder() which takes two integer num1 and num2 as an input parameter and return the remainder when num1 is divided by num2.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)<br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= num1 <= 106<br>
1 <= num2 <= 106
