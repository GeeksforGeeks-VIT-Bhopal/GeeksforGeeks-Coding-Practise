# Square root of a number 

Given an integer **x**, find the square root of x. If **x** is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).


**Example 1:**
```
Input:
x = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
x = 4

Output: 2

Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect 
square, so its square root is 2.
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function **floorSqrt()** which takes x as the input parameter and return its square root.<br>
**Note:** Try Solving the question without using sqrt Function.

 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(log N)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
