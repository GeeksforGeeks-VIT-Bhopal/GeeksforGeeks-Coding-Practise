# Kth smallest element
Given an array arr[] and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
K = 3

Output : 7

Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = 7 10 4 20 15
K = 4

Output : 15

Explanation :
4th smallest element in the given 
array is 15.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **kthSmallest()** which takes the array arr[], integers l and r denoting the starting and ending index of the array and an integer K as input and returns the Kth smallest element.
  
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
