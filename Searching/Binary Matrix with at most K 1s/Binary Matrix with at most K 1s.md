# Binary Matrix with at most K 1s
Given a binary matrix M with R rows and C columns, where each element of the matrix will be 0 or 1. Find the largest square that can be formed with center (i, j) and contains atmost K 1â€™s. There are Q queries, a single query has two integers denoting the centre (i,j) of the square.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
R = 4, C = 5
M = {{1, 0, 1, 0, 0} 
     {1, 0, 1, 1, 1} 
     {1, 1, 1, 1, 1} 
     {1, 0, 0, 1, 0}}
K = 9, Q = 1
q_i[] = {1}
q_j[] = {2}
Output:
3
Explanation:
Maximum length square with center
at (1, 2) that can be formed is of
3 length from (0, 1) to (2, 4).
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
R = 3, C = 3
M = {{1, 1, 1} 
     {1, 1, 1} 
     {1, 1, 1}}
K = 9, Q = 2
q_i[] = {1, 2}
q_j[] = {1, 2}
Output :
3 1
```
**Your Task:**<br>  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **largestSquare()** which takes 2 integers R, and C followed by a list of lists M denoting the binary matrix and then three integers i,j, and K as input and returns a list of integers denting the largest Square possible for each query.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(R*C + Q*log(MIN_DIST)), where MIN_DIST is the minimum distance of the center from the edges of the matrix where MIN_DIST is the minimum distance of the center from the edges of the matrix.<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(R*C)
