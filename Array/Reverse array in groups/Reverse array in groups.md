# Reverse array in groups

Given an array arr[] of positive integers of size N. Reverse every sub-array group of size K.


**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 5, K = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 3 2 1 5 4
Explanation: First group consists of elements
1, 2, 3. Second group consists of 4,5.
``` 

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 4, K = 3
arr[] = {5,6,8,9}
Output: 8 6 5 9
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function reverseInGroups() which takes the array, N and K as input parameters and modifies the array in-place. 

 

**Expected Time Complexity: O(N)**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)**
