# Matrix Interchange - Java

Working with 2D arrays is quite important. Here we will do swapping of column in a 2D array. You are given a matrix M or r rows and c columns. You need to swap the first column with the last column.

**Example:**
```
Input:<br>
3 4<br>
1 2 3 4<br>
4 3 2 1<br>
6 7 8 9

Output:<br>
4 2 3 1<br>
1 3 2 4<br>
9 7 8 6
```
**Your Task:**<br>
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided function interchange(int, int , int ) that take matrix, rows and columns as parameters.
