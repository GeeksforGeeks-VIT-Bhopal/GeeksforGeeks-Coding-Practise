# Nearly Sorted Algorithm

Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position. The task is to print array in sorted form.

**Input:**<br>
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of two integers N and K, denoting number of elements in array and at most k positions away from its target position respectively. Second line of every test case consists of elements of array.

**Output:**<br>
Single line output to print the sorted array.

**Example:**<br>
**Input:**<br>
2<br>
3 3<br>
2 1 3<br>
6 3<br>
2 6 3 12 56 8<br>
**Output:**<br>
1 2 3<br>
2 3 6 8 12 56
