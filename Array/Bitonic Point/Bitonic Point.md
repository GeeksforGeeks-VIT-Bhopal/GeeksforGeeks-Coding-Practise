# Bitonic Point 

Given an array arr of n elements which is first increasing and then may be decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
Note: If the array is increasing then just print then last element will be the maximum value.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
n = 9
arr[] = {1,15,25,45,42,21,17,12,11}
Output: 45
Explanation: Maximum element is 45.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
n = 5
arr[] = {1, 45, 47, 50, 5}
Output: 50
Explanation: Maximum element is 50.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaximum() which takes the array arr[], and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(logn)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
