# C++ Array (print an element) | Set 2 

Given an array A[] of N integers and an index Key. Your task is to print the element present at index key in the array.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
5 2
10 20 30 40 50
Output:
30
``` 

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
7 4
10 20 30 40 50 60 70
Output:
50
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findElementAtIndex() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer Key as inputs and returns the element present at index Key.


**Expected Time Complexity: O(1)**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)**

 

**Constraints:**<br>
1 ≤ N ≤ 100<br>
0 ≤ Key ≤ N - 1<br>
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100
