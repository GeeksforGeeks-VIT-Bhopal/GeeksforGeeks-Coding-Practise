# Binary Array Sorting

Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing order.

**Note:** The binary array contains only 0  and 1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,0,1,1,0}
Output: 0 0 1 1 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 10
A[] = {1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0}
Output: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Your Task:**<br>
Complete the function SortBinaryArray() which takes given array as input and returns the sorted array. 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

**Challenge:** Try doing it in one pass.
