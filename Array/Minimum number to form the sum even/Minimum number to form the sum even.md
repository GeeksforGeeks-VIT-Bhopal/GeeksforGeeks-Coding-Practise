# Minimum number to form the sum even

Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to add the minimum number(should be greater than 0) to the array so that the sum of the array becomes even

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 8
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Output:  2
Explanation:  Sum of array is 36, so 
we add minimum number 2 to make the 
sum even.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: N = 9
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Output:  1
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function minNum() that takes array A and integer N as parameters and returns the minimum number required to the array so that the sum becomes even.

 

**Expected Time Complexity: O(N).**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).**
