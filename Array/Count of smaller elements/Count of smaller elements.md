# Count of smaller elements

Given an sorted array A of size N. Find number of elements which are less than or equal to given element X.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 6
A[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10}
X = 9
Output:
5
``` 

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 7
A[] = {1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 7, 9}
X = 2
Output:
4
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countOfElements() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer X as inputs and returns the number of elements which are less than or equal to given element.

 

**Expected Time Complexity: O(N)**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)**
