# Wave Array

Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2 1 4 3 5
Explanation: Array elements after 
sorting it in wave form are 
2 1 4 3 5.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
n = 6
arr[] = {2,4,7,8,9,10}
Output: 4 2 8 7 10 9
Explanation: Array elements after 
sorting it in wave form are 
4 2 8 7 10 9.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
The task is to complete the function convertToWave() which converts the given array to wave array.

**Expected Time Complexity: O(n).**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).**
