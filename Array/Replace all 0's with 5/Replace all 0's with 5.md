# Replace all 0's with 5 

You are given an integer N. You need to convert all zeroes of N to 5.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 1004
Output: 1554
Explanation: There are two zeroes in 1004
on replacing all zeroes with "5", the new
number will be "1554".
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 121
Output: 121
Explanation: Since there are no zeroes in
"121", the number remains as "121".
```
**Your Task:**<br>
Your task is to complete the function convertFive() which takes an integer N as an argument and replaces all zeros in the number N with 5. Your function should return the converted number.

**Expected Time Complexity**: O(K) where K is the number of digits in N<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
