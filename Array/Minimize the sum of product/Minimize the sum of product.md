# Minimize the sum of product

You are given two arrays, A and B, of equal size N. The task is to find the minimum value of A[0] * B[0] + A[1] * B[1] +â€¦+ A[N-1] * B[N-1], where shuffling of elements of arrays A and B is allowed.


**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 3 
A[] = {3, 1, 1}
B[] = {6, 5, 4}
Output:
23 
Explanation:
1*6+1*5+3*4 = 6+5+12
= 23 is the minimum sum
``` 

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {6, 1, 9, 5, 4}
B[] = {3, 4, 8, 2, 4}
Output:
80
Explanation:
2*9+3*6+4*5+4*4+8*1
=18+18+20+16+8
= 80 is the minimum sum
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minValue() which takes the arrays A[], B[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum sum.
 


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N. log(N))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
