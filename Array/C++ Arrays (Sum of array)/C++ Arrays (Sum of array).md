# C++ Arrays (Sum of array)

Given an array of N integers. Your task is to print the sum of all of the integers.
 

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
4
1 2 3 4
Output:
10
``` 

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
6
5 8 3 10 22 45
Output:
93
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getSum() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the sum of array in a new line.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
0 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 200
