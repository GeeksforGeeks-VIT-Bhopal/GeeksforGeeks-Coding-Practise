# Sum of Array Elements

Given an integer array arr of size n, you need to sum the elements of arr.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
n = 3
arr[] = {3 2 1}
Output: 6
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1 2 3 4}
Output: 10
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You need to complete the function sumElement() that takes arr and n and returns the sum. The printing is done by the driver code.

**Expected Time Complexity: O(n).**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).**
