# Find minimum and maximum element in an array

Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 6
A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
Output:
min = 1, max =  10000
``` 

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 5
A[]  = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}
Output:
min = 1, max = 56789
``` 

**Your Task:** <br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.

 

**Expected Time Complexity: O(N)**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)**
