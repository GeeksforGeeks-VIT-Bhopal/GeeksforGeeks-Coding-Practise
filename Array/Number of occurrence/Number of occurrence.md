# Number of occurrence

Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 7, X = 2
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 4
Explanation: 2 occurs 4 times in the
given array.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 7, X = 4
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: 4 is not present in the
given array.
```
Your Task:<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count() which takes the array of integers arr, n and x as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(logN)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
