# Count the Zeros

Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's. The array is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. Find the count of all the 0's.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 12
Arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 0's in the given array.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 0's in the array.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countZeroes() which takes the array of integers arr[] and its size n as input parameters and returns the number of zeroes present in the array.


**Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)**<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)**
