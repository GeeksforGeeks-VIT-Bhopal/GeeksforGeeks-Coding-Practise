Your task is to calculate sum  of primes present as digits of given number N.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 333
Output: 9

**Your Task:**<br>
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **primeSum()** which takes N as input parameter and returns the sum of all the prime digits present in the number N.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(logN)<br>
