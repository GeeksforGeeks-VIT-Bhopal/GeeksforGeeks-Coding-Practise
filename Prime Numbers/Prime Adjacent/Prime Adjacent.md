# Prime Adjacent
Given a number N, you have to say if it is adjacent to two prime numbers. Two numbers are adjacent if the absolute difference between them is 1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 4
Output: Y
Explaination: The adjacent numbers 3 and
 5 are both prime.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 7
Output: N
Explaination: The numbers 6 and 8 are 
not prime.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **primeAdjacent()** which takes N as input parameter and reutrns 1 if it has two adjacent prime numbers, otherwise, returns 0.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(sqrt(N))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
