# Prime Palindrome Sum
Given is a range of integers [a , b]  . You have to find the sum of all the numbers in the range  [a , b] that are prime as well as palindrome.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
a = 1, b = 10
Output:
17
Explanation:
prime numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 3,
5, and 7. All of these are Palindromes.
So, sum = 17.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
a = 11, b = 13
Output:
11
Explanation:
prime numbers between 11 and 13 are 11
and 13. Omly 11 is Palindrome among these.
So, sum = 11. 
``` 
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **getPPS()** which takes 2 Integers a and b as input and returns an integer as the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(loglog(B))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(B)
