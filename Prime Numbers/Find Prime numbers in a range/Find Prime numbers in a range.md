# Find Prime numbers in a range
Given two integers M and N, generate all primes between M and N.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
M=1,N=10
Output:
2 3 5 7
Explanation:
The prime numbers between 1 and 10
are 2,3,5 and 7.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
M=2, N=5
Output:
2,3,5
Explanation:
The prime numbers between 2 and 5 are 
2,3 and 5.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **primeRange()** which takes 2 integer inputs M and N and returns a list of all primes between M and N.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N*sqrt(N))<br>
**Expected Auxillary Space:** O(1)
