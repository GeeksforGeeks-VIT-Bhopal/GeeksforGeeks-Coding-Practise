# Mathematical manipulation
Given a number n, find the total numbers, less than or equal to n which have at-least one common factor with n other than 1.
 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: For n=6, the 4 numbers having 
a common factor between them and 6 
are : 2, 3, 4 & 6
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 15
Output: 7
Explanation: For N=15, the 7 numbers having a 
common factor between them and 15 
are : 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15
``` 
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **CommonFactor()** which takes n as input parameter and returns total numbers. less than or equal to n which have atleast one common factor with n other than 1.
 
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(nlog(n))<br>
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(n)
