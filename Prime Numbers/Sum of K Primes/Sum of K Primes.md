# Sum of K Primes
Given two numbers N and K. Find out if ‘N’ can be written as a sum of ‘K’ prime numbers.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 10 and K = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
10 can be written as 5 + 5
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 2 and K = 2
Output: 0
```
**Your Task:**<br> 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **isSumOfKprimes()** which takes the integer N and an integer K as input parameters and returns the true if N can be expressed as a sum of K primes else return false.
If function returns true, driver code will print 1 in output and 0 if the function returns false.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(SQRT(N))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
