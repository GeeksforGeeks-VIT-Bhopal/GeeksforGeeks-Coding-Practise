# Almost Prime Numbers
A no is said to be  k-Almost Prime Number if it  has exactly k prime factors (not necessary distinct). Your task is to complete the function **printKAlmostPrimes** which takes two argument k and N and prints the  first N numbers that are k prime. 

**Input:**<br>
The first line of input is the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow . Each test case contains two integers k and N .

**Output:**<br>
For each test case output will be N space separated first N numbers that are k prime numbers.

**Constraints:**<br>
1<=T<=100<br>
1<=k<=10<br>
1<=N<=50

**Example(To be used only for expected output):**<br>
**Input**<br>
1<br>
2 5

**Output**<br>
4 6 9 10 14

**Explanation**<br>
In above test case<br>
4 has two prime factors, 2 x 2<br>
6 has two prime factors, 2 x 3<br>
Similarly, 9(3 x 3), 10(2 x 5) and 14(2 x 7)
