# Strong Numbers

**Strong Numbers** are the numbers whose sum of factorial of digits is equal to the original number. Given a number N, the task is to check if it is a Strong Number or not. Print 1 if the Number is Strong, else Print 0.


**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 145
Output:
1
Explanation:
1! + 4! + 5! = 145 So, 145 is a Strong
Number and therefore the Output 1.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 14
Output:
0
Explanation:
1! + 4! = 25 So, 14 isn't a Strong
Number and therefore the Output "NO".
```

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isStrong() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(|N|)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
