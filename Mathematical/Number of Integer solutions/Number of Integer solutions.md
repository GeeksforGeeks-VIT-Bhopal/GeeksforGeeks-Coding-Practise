# Number of Integer solutions

You are given a positive integer N and you have to find the number of non negative integral solutions to a+b+c=N.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 10
Output:
66
Explanation:
There are 66 possible solutions.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 20
Output:
231
Explanation:
There are 231 possible solutions.
```

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function noOfIntSols() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the number of integer solutions possible.

 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
