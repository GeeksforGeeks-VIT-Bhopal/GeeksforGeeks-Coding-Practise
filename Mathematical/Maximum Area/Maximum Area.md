# Maximum Area

Given the maximum possible area of the right angle triangle for a fixed length of hypotenuse. The task is to find the length of hypotenuse.

**Note:** If the answer comes in Decimal, find it's Floor value.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 25
Output:
10
Explanation:
For a maximum area of 25 square Units
of a Right-angled Triangle,
the length of it's Hypotenuse is 10.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 21
Output:
9
Explanation:
For a maximum area of 21 square Units
of a Right-angled Triangle, the
length of it's Hypotenuse is 9.165 = 9.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getHypotenuse() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
