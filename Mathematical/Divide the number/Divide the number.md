# Divide the number 

Given a positive integer N, count the number of possible ways to represent N as the sum of four positive integers.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 5
Output:
1
Explanation:
We can represent 5 as
a sum of 4 positive integers,
only in 1 way as 1+1+1+2 = 5
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 41
Output:
511
Explanation:
We can represent 41 as
sum of 4 positive integers
in 511 ways
```

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countWays() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns an integer, the total count of the number of ways N can be represented as sum of 4 positive numbers.
 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N4)<br>
**Expected Space Complexity:O(1)**
