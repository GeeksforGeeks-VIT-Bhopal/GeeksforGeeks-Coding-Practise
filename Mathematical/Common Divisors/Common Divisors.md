# Common Divisors

Given two integer numbers a and b, the task is to find count of all common divisors of given numbers.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: a = 12, b = 24
Output: 6 
Explanation: all common divisors 
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: a = 3, b = 17
Output: 1
Explanation: all common divisors are 1.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function commDiv() which takes n as input parameter and returns the number of common divisors.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(sqrt(n))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
