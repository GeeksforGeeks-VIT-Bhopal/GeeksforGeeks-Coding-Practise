# Swap two numbers

Swap given two numbers and print them. (Try to do it without a temporary variable.) and return it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: a = 13, b = 9
Output: 9 13
Explanation: after swapping it
becomes 9 and 13.
```

```
Input: a = 15, b = 8
Output: 8 15
Explanation: after swapping it
becomes 8 and 15.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function get() which takes a, b as inputs and returns the list of integers contains the new value of a and b after swap.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
