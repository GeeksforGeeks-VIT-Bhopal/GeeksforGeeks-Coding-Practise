# Half N by M

Given two values N and M. Give the value when N is halved M-1 times.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 100, M = 4
Output: 12
Explaination: The sequence of numbers is 
100, 50, 25, 12.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: N = 10, M = 5
Output: 0
Explaination: The sequence is 10, 5, 2, 1 and 0.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function mthHalf() which takes N and M as input  parameters and retunrs the value of N when it is halved M-1 times.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(log(max(N, M)))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
