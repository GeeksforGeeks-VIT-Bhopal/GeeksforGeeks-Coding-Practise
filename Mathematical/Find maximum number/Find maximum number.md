# Find maximum number 

Given a number N, write a program to find a maximum number that can be formed using all of the digits of this number.<br>
**Note:** The given number can be very large, so the input is taken as a String.


**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = "38293367"
Output:
98763332 
Explanation:
98763332 is the largest number that
can be formed by rearranging the
digits of N.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = "1203465"
Output:
6543210
Explanation:
6543210 is the largest number that
can be formed by rearranging the
digits of N.
``` 

**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMax() which takes a String N as input and returns the answer.

 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(|N|)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(constant)
