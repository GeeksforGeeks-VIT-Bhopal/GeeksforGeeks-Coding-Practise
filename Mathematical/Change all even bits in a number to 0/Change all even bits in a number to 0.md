# Change all even bits in a number to 0

Given a number N, change all bits at even positions to 0.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 30
Output: 10 
Explanation: Binary representation of 
11110. Bits at Even positions are 
highlighted. After making all of them 
0, we get 01010. Hence the answer is 10.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:  N = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: Binary representation of 
1010. Bits at Even positions are 
highlighted. After making all of them 
0, we get 1010. Hence the answer is 10.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function convertEvenBitToZero() which takes n as input parameter and returns the value of N after changing bits at even positions.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
