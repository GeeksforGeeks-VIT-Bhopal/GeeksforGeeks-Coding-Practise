# Mean

Given the marks of N students in an Array A, calculate the mean.

**Note:** If result is a Decimal Value, find it's floor Value.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 4 
A = { 56 , 67 , 30 , 79 }
Output:
58
Explanation:
56+67+30+79 = 232;  232/4 = 58.
So, the Output is 58.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 4 
A = { 78 , 89 , 67 , 76 }
Output:
77
Explanation:
78+89+67+76  = 310;  310/4 = 77.5 = 77.
So, the Output is 77.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function mean() which takes 1 Integer N and an Array A as input and returns the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
