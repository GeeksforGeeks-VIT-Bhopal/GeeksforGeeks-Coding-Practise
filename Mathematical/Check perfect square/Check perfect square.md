# Check perfect square

Given a positive integer n, check if it is perfect square or not.<br>
**NOTE:** Try to solve the question using only addition and subtraction operation.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 35
Output: 0 
Explanation: 35 is not perfect
square because sqrt(35) = 5 but
5*5 !=35.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 49
Output: 1
Explanation: sqrt(49) = 7 and 
7*7 = 49, Hence 49 is perfect square. 
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function isPerfectSquare() which takes n as input parameter and returns 1 if n is a perfect square else return 0.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(sqrt(n))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
