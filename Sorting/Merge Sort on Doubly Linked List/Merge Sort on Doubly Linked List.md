# Merge Sort on Doubly Linked List
Given Pointer/Reference to the head of a doubly linked list of N nodes, the task is to Sort **the given doubly linked list using Merge Sort** in both **non-decreasing** and **non-increasing** order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 8
value[] = {7,3,5,2,6,4,1,8}
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: After sorting the given
linked list in both ways, resultant
matrix will be as given in the first
two line of output, where first line
is the output for non-decreasing
order and next line is for non-
increasing order.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 5
value[] = {9,15,0,-1,0}
Output:
-1 0 0 9 15
15 9 0 0 -1
Explanation: After sorting the given
linked list in both ways, the
resultant list will be -1 0 0 9 15
in non-decreasing order and 
15 9 0 0 -1 in non-increasing order.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
The task is to complete the function **sortDoubly()** which sorts the doubly linked list. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.
