# Merge Sort
Given an array arr[], its starting position l and its ending position r. Sort the array using merge sort algorithm.
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 1 3 9 7}
Output:
1 3 4 7 9
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
N = 10
arr[] = {10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1}
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to take the input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function merge() which takes arr[], l, m, r as its input parameters and modifies arr[] in-place such that it is sorted from position l to position r, and function mergeSort() which uses merge() to sort the array in ascending order using merge sort algorithm.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(nlogn)<br> 
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(n)
