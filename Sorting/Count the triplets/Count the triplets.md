# Count the triplets
Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.
 
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 triplets: 
1 + 2 = 3 and 3 +2 = 5 
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {2, 3, 4}
Output: 0
Explanation: No such triplet exits
```
**Your Task:**<br> 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **countTriplet()** which takes the array arr[] and N as inputs and returns the triplet count

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N2)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
