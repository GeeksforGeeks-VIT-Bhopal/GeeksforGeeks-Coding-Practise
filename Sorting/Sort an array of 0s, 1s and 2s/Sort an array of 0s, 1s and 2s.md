# Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
0 0 1 2 2
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {0 1 0}
Output:
0 0 1
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.
```
**Your Task:**<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **sort012()** that takes an array arr and N as input parameters and sorts the array in-place.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
