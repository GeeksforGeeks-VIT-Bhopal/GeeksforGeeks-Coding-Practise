# Permutations in array
Given two arrays of equal size N and an integer K. The task is to check if after permuting both arrays, we get sum of their corresponding element greater than or equal to k i.e Ai + Bi >= K for all i (from 0 to N-1). Return true if possible, else false.
 
**Example 1:**
```
Input : 
a[] = {2, 1, 3}, 
b[] = { 7, 8, 9 }, 
k = 10. 
Output : 
True
Explanation:
Permutation  a[] = { 1, 2, 3 } 
and b[] = { 9, 8, 7 } 
satisfied the condition a[i] + b[i] >= K.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input : 
a[] = {1, 2, 2, 1}, b[] = { 3, 3, 3, 4 }, k = 5.
Output : 
False
Explanation:
Since any permutation won't give the answer.
 ```
**Your Task:**<br> 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **isPossible()** which takes the array A[], B[], its size N and an integer K as inputs and returns the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N. Log(N))<br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
